| **General**                 |                                  |                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| GEN-001                     | Framework & Setup                | As a developer, I need the project to start from a standard React setup (like CRA or Vite) with `App.js`.      | The development environment is initialized correctly, allowing development to start immediately within the `App` component structure. No backend or database setup is needed.         |
| GEN-002                     | Client-Side Only                 | As a user, I want the app to work entirely in my browser without needing an internet connection after loading. | The application state and logic are managed entirely client-side using React state. No data is persisted beyond the current session unless shared via URL.                            |
| GEN-003                     | Modern UI/UX                     | As a user, I want the app to look clean, modern, and be intuitive to use.                                      | The UI has a contemporary design, utilizes clear fonts, good spacing, incorporates emojis as requested, and follows a logical user flow.                                              |
| GEN-004                     | Responsive Design                | As a user, I want to use the app effectively on my phone, tablet, or desktop.                                  | The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Elements like buttons, inputs, and lists are easily viewable and interactable on small screens (mobile-first approach).       |
| **Participant Management**  |                                  |                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PM-001                      | Add Participant Input            | As a BBQ organizer, I want an input field to type the name of a friend attending the BBQ.                      | An `<input type="text">` field is visible on the page, allowing text entry.                                                                                                           |
| PM-002                      | Add Participant Button           | As a BBQ organizer, I want a button to click after typing a name, to add them to the list.                     | An "Add Participant" button is present. Clicking it triggers the addition logic.                                                                                                      |
| PM-003                      | Participant List Display         | As a BBQ organizer, I want to see a list of all the friends I've added so far.                                 | A section on the page dynamically displays the names of added participants.                                                                                                           |
| PM-004                      | Clear Input After Add            | As a user, I want the name input field to clear automatically after I add a participant.                       | After clicking "Add Participant" and the name is successfully added to the list, the input field becomes empty, ready for the next name.                                              |
| PM-005                      | Vegan Status Indicator           | As a BBQ organizer, I need to mark if a participant is vegan.                                                  | Next to each participant's name in the list, a checkbox or toggle switch is displayed (using flexbox for layout). The state (checked/unchecked, on/off) is stored per participant.    |
| PM-006                      | Vegan Status Default             | As a BBQ organizer, I assume most participants are not vegan unless specified otherwise.                       | When a participant is added, their vegan status defaults to false (non-vegan). The user can then change it if needed.                                                                 |
| _(Optional)_ PM-007         | Remove Participant               | As a BBQ organizer, I want to be able to remove someone from the list if they can no longer attend.            | An 'X' icon or "Remove" button appears next to each participant. Clicking it removes the participant from the list and updates the UI.                                                |
| **Food/Beverage Selection** |                                  |                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FS-001                      | Meat Selection Dropdown          | As a BBQ organizer, I want to select the primary type of meat for the BBQ from a predefined list.              | A dropdown menu (`<select>`) labelled "Select Meat Type" is displayed. It contains options like "Sausages üå≠", "Wurstel üçñ", "Ribs ü•©", etc., plus a default placeholder.             |
| FS-002                      | Beverage Selection Dropdown      | As a BBQ organizer, I want to select the primary type of beverage for the BBQ from a predefined list.          | A dropdown menu (`<select>`) labelled "Select Beverage Type" is displayed. It contains options like "Beer üç∫", "Wine üç∑", "Coca-Cola ü•§", etc., plus a default placeholder.           |
| FS-003                      | Non-Meat Food Selection Dropdown | As a BBQ organizer, I want to select the primary type of side dish/non-meat food for the BBQ.                  | A dropdown menu (`<select>`) labelled "Select Side Dish" is displayed. It contains options like "Potatoes ü•î", "Peppers üå∂Ô∏è", "Zucchini ü•í", etc., plus a default placeholder.         |
| FS-004                      | Store Selections                 | As a user, I expect the app to remember the food and drink items I selected.                                   | The selected value from each of the three dropdowns is stored in the React component's state.                                                                                         |
| **Calculation & Results**   |                                  |                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| CR-001                      | "Calculate Needs" Button         | As a BBQ organizer, I want a button to calculate the total food/drink needed based on my inputs.               | A button labelled "Calculate Needs" (or similar) is present. Clicking it triggers the calculation logic.                                                                              |
| CR-002                      | Calculation Logic                | As a BBQ organizer, I need the app to calculate quantities based on participants and vegan status.             | The app calculates total meat (for non-vegans), total beverages (for all), and total non-meat food (considering higher amounts for vegans), based on predefined multipliers.          |
| CR-003                      | Display Totals                   | As a BBQ organizer, I want to see the total amount calculated for each selected item.                          | After calculation, a section displays the selected items (with emojis) and their total required quantities (e.g., "Sausages üå≠: 10", "Beer üç∫: 8", "Potatoes ü•î: 7").                 |
| CR-004                      | Display Participant Summary      | As a BBQ organizer, I want to see a quick summary of the participants included in the calculation.             | The results section displays the total number of participants and the count of vegan participants.                                                                                    |
| CR-005                      | Suggested Distribution           | As a BBQ organizer, I want a suggestion on how to divide the items fairly among participants.                  | The results section includes a list suggesting how items could be split (e.g., "Alice: 2 Sausages, 1 Beer, 1 Potato", "Bob (Vegan): 2 Beers, 2 Potatoes"). Respects vegan constraint. |
| CR-006                      | Prevent Calculation Errors       | As a user, I want the app to prevent calculation if I haven't added participants or selected items.            | The "Calculate Needs" button may be disabled or show a message if no participants exist or if any of the food/beverage dropdowns are still on their default/unselected value.         |
| **Export & Share**          |                                  |                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| EX-001                      | "Export for Group Chat" Button   | As a BBQ organizer, I want a button to generate a text summary of the plan for easy sharing.                   | A button labelled "Export for Group Chat" (or similar) is present near the results.                                                                                                   |
| EX-002                      | Generate Export Text             | As a BBQ organizer, when I click export, I want pre-formatted text ready to copy/paste.                        | Clicking the export button generates a plain text string including totals, participant list, and suggested contributions, formatted for readability in chat apps (like WhatsApp).     |
| EX-003                      | Display Export Text for Copying  | As a user, I need an easy way to copy the generated export text.                                               | The generated text is displayed in a modal, alert, or `<textarea>` element, allowing the user to easily select and copy it.                                                           |
| SH-001                      | "Share Plan" Button              | As a BBQ organizer, I want a button to generate a special link containing my current BBQ plan.                 | A button labelled "Share Plan" (or similar) is present.                                                                                                                               |
| SH-002                      | Generate Sharable Link           | As a BBQ organizer, clicking "Share Plan" should give me a URL that encodes the current setup.                 | Clicking the button serializes the participant list (names, vegan status) and food/drink selections into a string (e.g., JSON), encodes it (Base64/URIComponent), and forms a URL.    |
| SH-003                      | Display Sharable Link            | As a user, I need to easily copy the generated share link.                                                     | The generated URL (e.g., `app-url.com/?plan=ENCODED_STRING`) is displayed in a read-only input or prompt for the user to copy.                                                        |
| SH-004                      | Load State from URL Parameter    | As a user receiving a shared link, I want the app to automatically load the plan when I open the link.         | On page load, the app checks for the `plan` query parameter in the URL. If present, it decodes the value, parses it, and pre-populates the participant list and selections.           |
